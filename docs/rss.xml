     <description><![CDATA[<p>MMT takes the view that monetary policy is largely useless as a stabilisation device, and what is known as the horizontal circuit (&quot;bank money&quot;) should be left to operate as a market rather than being manipulated all the time. Therefore you leave the base rate at the natural rate of 0% and stop artificially trying to hold it above that, particularly stop moving it around. </p><p>What that means is that government stops paying banks &quot;welfare on reserves&quot; payments. No Interest on Reserves. No Bond Coupons. Any income banks earn they have to get by discounting collateral in the private economy and charging for that service (aka making loans).</p><p>System stabilisation can then be done using the vertical circuit (&quot;central bank money&quot;) which is added and removed as required to commercial bank's balance sheets and forcibly creates additional bank deposits in the hands of individuals - because bank money is pegged one-to-one to central bank money. </p><p>The result is that the bank money system operates within a containment vessel defined by fixed banking policies, not ones that change month to month, and the banking system ebbs and flows within the policy boundaries, with the government's vertical system countercyclically matching the ebb and flow.</p><p>This is where the Job Guarantee sits. The wage is paid with vertical money and matches the ebb and flow of bank money spending countercyclically. But importantly it does the same thing on the production side with labour hours - injecting and removing labour hours countercyclically with private and public sector demand keeping labour hours near constant relative to the working population. </p><p>A guaranteed alternative job replaces bank credit manipulation as the stabilisation process. The production system gets a change in output, not a dead loss. You get income in your pocket, not a debt millstone around your neck. </p><p>And that's how you get to true full employment and price stability within an economic system where demand is satisfied. </p>]]>

     <description><![CDATA[<p>I note that the Hard of Accounting are out in force again pushing their fallacious line that Taxes Must Rise because we decided to use government to save the economy in the face of a nasty pandemic.</p><p>There must be Fire and Brimstone. The Sin must be Purged.</p><p>Clueless idiots the lot of them - particularly those at the ironically named Institute for Fiscal Studies who really ought to know better. (If they do study Fiscal they don't do it very effectively).</p><p>This is how it works in reality.</p><p>You receive some furlough pay, which is taxed, you spend that money at a shop, which is taxed, they pay their staff which is taxed, who spend that money at a shop, which is taxed and so on. </p><p>Imagine a stone skipping across a pond where every bounce is a transaction and every ripple is taxation. </p><p>If you expand that sequence you'll find that eventually the initial injection of money (G) for the furlough pay disappears in taxation (T). Or as it tends to be written mathematically:</p><p><span><span class="katex-display"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>δ</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>G</mi><mo>−</mo><mi>T</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex"> \delta(G - T) = 0 </annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mord mathdefault" style="margin-right:0.03785em;">δ</span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord mathdefault">G</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222222222222222em;"></span><span class="mbin">−</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222222222222222em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mord mathdefault" style="margin-right:0.13889em;">T</span><span class="mclose">)</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span><span class="mrel">=</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.64444em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord">0</span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p>Bonds come about when not everybody in the sequence spends all their money - aka saving. There's been a lot of that recently due to frightened people increasing their rainy day funds, people paying off loans and simple lack of opportunities to spend.</p><p>The increase in Savings (S) and decrease in Loans (I) creates a government deficit.

A Bond is a pause button in the spending sequence. </p><p>Eventually the sunny uplands will return, people will feel less frightened, go to the shops more, and break out the credit card again. And that is like hitting 'play' on our sequence. The saved money is then spent at a shop, which is taxed, who pay their staff, which is taxed, who then spend at the shop, which is taxed... The bouncing continues, creating a decrease in savings and/or an increase in Loans.

     <title> From Furlough to Full-Employment - Part Deux </title>

     <description><![CDATA[<p>The idea is to provide real people with the ability to sell their hours automatically.</p><p>In my current design you are always on the default PAYE scheme, which kicks in as soon as fewer than 35 hours are booked to another PAYE scheme. That drops you onto the &quot;volunteer list&quot; for the unbooked hours doing the &quot;looking for a JG position&quot; job by default (a rather more useful version of the current 35 hours &quot;job seeking&quot; requirement of Universal Credit - looking for jobs that cannot exist in aggregate).</p><p>You can then contact a Work Coach to have yourself taken off that job if you'd prefer not to bother with the process, or to investigate what is on offer and get something lined up. If you don't contact a Work Coach, or they can't easily contact you, then they will suspend payment until you do. Just as would happen if you didn't turn up to work in any other job. I want the process to be automatic, and the registration and verification details submitted in the PAYE Returns by the previous PAYE employer. No forms to fill in.</p><p>Running through the usual use cases I believe this process handles full-time, part-time and temporary, whether they want to be engaged with the Job Guarantee or not.</p><p>Beyond that it's up to you. But you only get paid for hours booked to the Job Guarantee. Since there is a job on offer, you will take it if you are short of money. If you're not short of money and have savings or redundancy then you can take your time. Those with scarce skills higher up the tree will be able to negotiate those protections into their employment contracts - particularly if they unionise.</p><p>How long you can be on the &quot;looking for a JG position&quot; job before you are required to move on I've not really thought about very much (largely because I suspect everybody will want to get off it as soon as possible). I don't believe there is a time limit in Universal Credit, but given the higher level of payment on the Job Guarantee perhaps you will have to put your case to a jury of your peers after a period of time - particularly if you can choose to go on the JG.</p>]]>

We could move from Furlough to Full Employment tomorrow and solve the whole problem in one shot. </p><p>PAYE needs to capture the bank account details of the employed - along with the hours worked on that PAYE scheme. That is then associated with an NI number and checked to make sure the addresses are UK based and tie up. </p><p>We then top people up at the living wage up to 35 hours per week if they have an NI number that has been paid elsewhere in the last year, but are not currently receiving sufficient money. Essentially we create a default PAYE scheme everybody is enrolled upon paid directly from the Ways and Means Account at the Bank of England. </p><p>If the self-employed want to be part of the scheme they need to run their drawing through PAYE. Giving them that options allows us to phase out and get rid of class 2 and class 4. </p><p>Then anybody who is on the default PAYE scheme is added to the famous &quot;volunteer list&quot; as labour for government to use as it sees fit.</p><p>A reserve army of workers. And the Universal Credit Work Coaches can be tasked with finding them all something to do for their money. </p>]]>

     <description><![CDATA[<p>Why do those people who agitate for a fixed exchange rate between currencies also advocate for a floating rate between government bonds and the currency?</p><p>If a move between bonds and currency needs to be discouraged by a floating rate, then why doesn't a move between a local currency and a foreign currency need to be discouraged by a floating rate? </p><p>If the Euro is such a great idea across such a wide area, why aren't Eurozone government bonds payable at par on demand at any bank in the Eurozone?</p><p>After all they are just unspent savings. </p>]]>

     <description><![CDATA[<p>This came to me the other day, when I realised that, in any Robin Hood tale, they never show the ordinary people until the last few minutes of the film when they are handing out the spoils.</p><hr><h2 class="">Scene 1 - Nottingham Castle.</h2><p>[Robin Hood surprises the Sheriff and holds him at the point of a sword. ]</p><p>&quot;So finally I have you, now lead me to the Gold.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I'm afraid I no longer have any. The king has replaced all the Gold with these pieces of paper. [Hold up fistfuls of notes]. You'll have to talk to him&quot;</p><p>&quot;And so I shall&quot; [Robin dashes off flamboyantly ] [Cut to scene with the sheriff laughing maniacally with his pile of notes, shouting &quot;I'm rich, rich. Rich beyond my wildest dreams&quot;, etc].</p><h2 class="">Scene 2 - Kings chambers</h2><p>[Robin drops in to the kings chamber, draws his sword and points to the King]</p><p>&quot;So finally I have you, now lead me to the Gold&quot;</p><p>[King sits laconically in throne, looks up from his book, and chuckles]</p><p>&quot;Gold? We haven't used Gold since 1171. Have a look yourself, the vaults over there&quot; [Points].</p><p>[Robin checks the empty room, looks puzzled].</p><p>&quot;But how do you run the country without Gold?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh I use one of those&quot; [Pan to computer, Robin looks surprised, pan back to King] &quot;Just type in the numbers and boom everybody get paid. That keeps all the serfs engaged, and they produce all the output. Have you thought about speaking to the serfs?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I shall see the serfs when I have the Gold. As is traditional this will be in the last ten seconds of the film when they cheer my entrance into their villages and I dispense the alms from the back of my horse&quot; [Robin flicks hair majestically].</p><p>&quot;I speak to them all the time. As an English King I can only rule by common consent. You might want to consider talking to the serfs a bit earlier, unless you think you know what they want better than they do just because you have a sword, a fancy bow and a degree in Outlawing from Herne University&quot;</p><p>&quot;I spent four years in the depths of Sherwood on that degree I'll have you know - including a gap year in the New Forest showing the locals how to hunt deer.  I will speak to the serfs then, if I must&quot;</p><p>[Robin Exits. King rolls eyes and goes back to his book]</p><h2 class="">Scene 3 - Serf village</h2><p>[Picture of serf in field]</p><p>&quot;Good sir, please tell me how the king oppresses you&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oppresses? No, we get well paid for our work in the king's money&quot;.</p><p>&quot;But you slave all day in the fields?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No. Mostly we use the machines&quot; [cut to archive footage of combines, crop sprayers covering huge areas, etc.] &quot;We just do a bit of weeding around the edges&quot;.</p><p>&quot;But the sheriff takes all you earn in taxes&quot;.</p><p>&quot;No. The king pays us in full. The Sheriff keeps those pieces of paper so he can count them. He likes counting them, they don't cost anything to produce, and in return his heavies keep the roads clear. We exchange money for proper stuff&quot; [Pan to house, car and family sat having a barbecue - who wave at Robin].</p><p>[Robin looks puzzled] &quot;But don't you want any Gold?&quot;.</p><p>&quot;Pfft What's the point in that. All that effort digging it out of the ground just to have to pay to store it again. We haven't had use of that stuff for years. Where have you been - hiding out in a forest or something?&quot;</p><p>[Robin looking shocked]. &quot;Well yes actually. And perhaps it's time I went back.  I just don't understand any of this any more. It's triggering me!&quot;.</p><p>[Rides off into sunset]</p><p>[Serf to camera] &quot;What a loser.

It conjures up a picture of an autocratic and irresponsible body which by some black art of its own contriving can increase or diminish wealth, and presumably make a great deal of profit in the process&quot;</p><p>For more see the <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.economania.co.uk/various-authors/post-war-banking-policy.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Economania review</a></p>]]>

     <description><![CDATA[<p>You've got to feel sorry for poor old Roger Bootle and his <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/06/28/misleading-claims-trendy-deficit-deniers-dangerous-ever/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">attempted hatchet job</a> in The Telegraph on <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://amzn.to/3dIFUnV" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Deficit Myth</a></p><p>He states &quot;It would be pretty extraordinary if the basic theory concerning the public finances... are to be proved wrong in 2020&quot; after stating the following &quot;higher debt means higher interest payments that have to be financed somehow or other&quot;. </p><p>Thereby showing that he has completely missed the point MMT highlights time and time again. Interest payments are received by bondholders <strong>and they are spent by bondholders</strong> which generates the taxation and additional saving that pays for them. There are no more taxes 'implied' in the future. It's all down to who is doing the spending at the time. People could all be saving, in which case the tax level will be less and even more spending will be required. The people in the future will have the savings in the future that exactly matches the debt. If and when they spend it, it automatically pays off the debt. Chances are they will keep on saving it because that generation intends to retire like this one does. </p><p>Moreover <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/hm-treasury-and-bank-of-england-announce-temporary-extension-of-the-ways-and-means-facility" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">as the government has already revealed </a> it could just use its overdraft at the Bank of England - which means any interest is essentially paid to itself. And if Roger really believes those Very Clever People at the bank can set an interest rate for the entire economy, surely they would have no problem setting an interest rate for a mere government. </p><p>The &quot;distinction between monetary and non-monetary financing&quot; is only &quot;critically important for preventing inflation&quot; in the minds of neoclassical economists who disappear down a self-referential rabbit hole of their own beliefs. MMT rejects the reliance on a natural rate of interest. There is no such thing. MMT says you don't need to pay interest to anybody because they are saving anyway - as they are already demonstrating or there wouldn't be any requirement to issue the bonds in the first place. </p><p>The entire piece is shot through with references to &quot;borrowing&quot; even though MMT shows that is a residual. Think about it: if you could set the interest rate at your bank, force the manager to give you whatever money you requested on the pain of sacking because you owned the bank outright, and you could decide if and when you wanted to pay any of it back would really you consider at that point that you are &quot;borrowing&quot;?</p><p>This is the &quot;what if you could spend like the government&quot; analogy - the mirror of the &quot;household analogy&quot;. You'd only be limited in your spending by what was available for sale in the currency you were obtaining. Which is exactly the position of the UK government. It is limited only by what resources Parliament will allow it to obtain.</p><p>Roger then quotes the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#%20https%3A%2F%2Ftheconversation.com%2Fthe-reinhart-rogoff-error-or-how-not-to-excel-at-economics-13646">widely debunked 90% fake figure from Reinhart and Rogoff </a>. You know an author is in trouble when they start quoting from papers that were forced to be withdrawn. Why even mention it other than to draw attention to how out of date your thinking is?</p><p>The constraints on the UK economy are real. We are about to have millions more people without work that want it all of whom could have a job tomorrow if we could just get past this irrational fear of inflation and the even more irrational idea that you can ward it off by a bunch of unelected wonks at a central bank performing a Wizard of Oz routine around a magical interest rate number they pulled out of their hats.</p><p>Time to retire Roger and leave the economics to those who understand how money works. People's livelihoods are at stake here. </p>]]>
